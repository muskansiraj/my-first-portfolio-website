        <h1><b>About me</b></h1>
        <p> Welcome to my corner of the web! I'mMUSKAN SALEEM,a passionate Front end web developer  with a deep love for creating innovative solutions that blend creativity with functionality. My journey started with a curiosity for coding and has since evolved into a full-fledged passion for transforming ideas into tangible projects that solve real-world problems.
            
            When I'm not web developer you'll likely find me exploring new technologies, diving into creative projects, or [a personal hobby or interest]. I believe in continuous growth, both professionally and personally, and I strive to bring that energy into every project I take on.
            
            Let's connect, collaborate, and create something impactful together.</p>
